## About

Mussels is a cross-platform and general-purpose dependency build automation tool.

Mussels helps automate the building of applications _and_ their versioned dependency chains using the original build systems intended by the software authors.

For a more in depth explanation, see the [Mussels Introduction](docs/introduction.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer.
- Git (must be added to your PATH environment variable).

An internet connection is required to use the public Mussels cookbooks. Some form of internet or intranet is required to download source archives from the URLs defined in each recipe.

Every recipe will require tools in order to run.  If you don't have the required tools, you'll get an error message stating that you're missing a required tool.  It will be up to you to install the tool in order for that recipe to build.

### Common Tools Requirements

Linux:

- gcc
- Make
- CMake
- patchelf

MacOS (Darwin):

- Clang (comes with XCode)
- Make
- CMake

Windows:

- Visual Studio 2017+
- CMake

## Installation

You may install Mussels from PyPI using `pip`, or you may clone the Mussels Git repository and use `pip` to install it locally.

Install Mussels from PyPI:

> `python3 -m pip install --user mussels`

## Usage

Use the `--help` option to get information about any Mussels command.

> `mussels`
>
> `mussels --help`
>
> `mussels build --help`

_Tip_: Use the `msl` shortcut, instead of `mussels` to save keystrokes.

_Tip_: You may not be able to run `mussels` or the `msl` shortcut directly if your Python Scripts directory is not in your `PATH` environment variable. If you run into this issue, and do not wish to add the Python Scripts directory to your path, you can run Mussels like this:

> `python -m mussels`

Learn more about how use Mussels in our [documentation](docs/usage.md).

## Contribute

Mussels is open source and we'd love your help. There are many ways to contribute!

### Contribute Recipes

You can contribute to the Mussels community by creating new recipes or improving on existing recipes in the ["scrapbook"](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/mussels-recipe-scrapbook). Do this by submitting a pull request to that Git repository.

If your project is willing to make your project-specific recipes available to the public, we'd also be happy to add your cookbook repository to the Mussels [bookshelf](mussels/bookshelf.py). Do this submitting a pull request to this Git repository. As noted above, each cookbook's license must be compatible with the Apache v2.0 license used by Mussels in order to be included in the bookshelf.

#### Mussels Development Set-up

The following steps are intended to help users that wish to contribute to development of the Mussels project get started.

1. Create a fork of the [Mussels git repository](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/Mussels), and then clone your fork to a local directory.

    For example:

    > `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/Mussels.git`

2. Make user Mussels is not already installed.  If it is, remove it.

    > `python3 -m pip uninstall mussels`

3. Use pip to install Mussels in "edit" mode.

    > `python3 -m pip install -e --user ./Mussels`

Once installed in "edit" mode, any changes you make to your clone of the Mussels code will be immediately usable simply by running the `mussels` / `msl` commands.
